# slideshow
A simple slideshow program for displaying fullscreen slides, which will randomly rotate through the slides.

Run slideshow-setup.py to download dependencies.
slideshow-scheduler.py is based on a use case where the slideshow drops out to show the desktop (or another program under it) intermittently.

NOTE: Change '/path/to/images' in the slideshow.py program to direct it to your images folder
